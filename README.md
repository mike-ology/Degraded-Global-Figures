# Degraded Global Figures Task
 
This scenario creates and presents degraded global images of circles and squares
generated from user parameters set in the parameter window. The program was developed with NBS Presentation (version 21.0). Consequently, this software and an appropriate license is required to run the experiment.

The original concept for these images is described in the paper below:

Huberle, E., & Karnath, H. O. (2012). The role of temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) 
in global Gestalt perception. *Brain Structure and Function*, 217(3), 735â€“746.

# Using the task
Make sure to check the parameters in the Experiment Parameter Window prior to running the experiment. The number of trials may vary vastly depending on what is specified and users must implement an adequate number of blocks to break up the trials adequately.
