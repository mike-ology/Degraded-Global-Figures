This scenario dynamically creates and presents degraded global images of circles and diamonds generated from user parameters set in the parameter window. The program was developed with NBS Presentation (version 21.0). Consequently, this software and an appropriate license is required to run the experiment.

The original concept for these images is described in the paper below:

in global Gestalt perception. *Brain Structure and Function*, 217(3), 735â€“746.

# Using the task
Make sure to check the parameters in the Experiment Parameter Window prior to running the experiment. The number of trials may vary vastly depending on what is specified and users must implement an adequate number of blocks to break up the trials adequately. When beginning the experiment, please use a subject number that ends with a digit as the program counter-balances response mapping across participants based on whether the last digit of the subject number being odd or even.

A slight pause in the program may occur prior to the beginning of the first block in each repetition of trials as the program generates new images. However, the brief pause occurs outside of the trial window and will not affect any trial timing.

The program generates a logfile table of data that includes accuracy and reaction time with separate lines for each trial (no lines for practice trials), but does not currently calculate any summary statistics. Users will need to calculate participant performance using their own software.

# The Stimuli

## The Local Level Stimuli
A total of 384 images are used for the stimuli that appear at the local level. The original sizing of these images are 310x310px, with the shape in each image occupying at 230x230px space. These images are scaled down for the actual experiment, but were generated at a higher resolution should higher resolutions be desired in the future.

The images vary according to several parameters:
- Shape: the main shape in each image was either a circle or a diamond
- Corner: the main shape was never centrally-presented and was always located closer to one of the four corners in the image
- Offset: the main shape was located either in the very corner of the image, or horizontally offset from the corner by 10px, 20px, or 30px (these distances are subject to scaling in the actual experiment).
- Shape Shading: The shape was subject to four different levels of shading: white, light gray, dark gray, or black. In percentages, the shading was 100% white (0% black), 67% white (33% black), 33% white (67% black), or 0% white (100% black). In RGB, the shading was (255, 255, 255), (171, 171, 171), (85, 85, 85), or (0, 0, 0).
- Background Shading: The background of the image was subject to identical shading. All combinations of shape and background shading were generated, except for those with identical shading (as the shape would not be able to be seen).
By programmatically generating an image with every possible combination of the above parameters (excluding shape and background identical shading), 384 images were generated that were used to construct the global stimuli.

An additional Presentation scenario that was used to generate the images is present in the package files.

## The Global Level Stimuli
These stimuli were constructed by arranging the local level stimuli into a 31 x 31 grid, and specifying certain parameters to make a global level circle or diamond appear in a 23 x 23 space on the 31 x 31 grid. Many of the characteristics of the global stimuli are similar to the local level stimuli, such as the corner offset of the shape and the shape/background shading. For each level of degradation, a minimum of 32 different figures are generated. This number may be multiplied by the number of 'offsets' used (maximum offsets = 4, maximum figures = 128). The figures themselves were presented on a neutral gray background (RGB: 128, 128, 128 ).

The images vary according to several parameters:
- Global Shape: the main shape in each image was either a circle or a diamond
- Local Shapes: the local elements in each image were either all circles or all diamonds (never mixed).
- Corner: the main shape was never centrally-presented and was always located closer to one of the four corners in the image.
- Offset: the main shape was located either in the very corner of the image, or horizontally offset from the corner by 1, 2, or 3 local elements (an offset of 4 local elements would make the main shape appear in the centre of the stimulus).
   - The number of offsets used is adjustable in the parameter window. If 1 offset is selected, global shapes will appear in the corners, and each additional offset (maximum 4) will generate additional global shapes that are closer to the centre.
- Shading: the stimuli were designated as either light-on-dark (light coloured shape on a dark background) or dark-on-light (a dark coloured shape on a light background). Certain local elements were used for either the light or dark sections of each stimulus:
   - Light section: This section was limited to local elements that were light gray shapes on a white background, or white shapes on a light gray background.
   - Dark-on-light This section was limited to local elements that were dark gray shapes on a black background, or black shapes on a dark gray background.

<p align="center"><i>From left-to-right, and top-to-bottom, illustrations of increasing levels of degradation: 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% degradation.</i></p>

Stimuli of different degradation levels can be selected by entering the desired degradation levels in the parameter window prior to running the experiment. The stimulus examples at the top of the document illustrate the effects of increasing degradation levels, beginning with 0 on the left. A value of 0 will generate images with 0% degradation whilst a value of 100 will generate images with 100& degradation. When each stimulus is generated, the degradation level for the current image will determine the chance that each local element is replaced with an element of random shading, rather than the shading required to construct the global shape. For each local element, a random number from 1-100 is generated, and if the random number is below the degradation level, a random local element that may or may not match the shading required to make a clear local shape is selected. Otherwise, a local element with correct shading is used.

# Other Experiment Parameters

## Experiment Length

Using many degradation levels will generate many unique trials, and using additional global offsets will further increase this number. Therefore it may be necessary to 'block' groups of trials together and provide participants with an opportunity for a break. Additional parameters are available in the Parameter Window.

- Maximum Blocks - This specifies how many unique blocks of trials are run. The total number of unique trials generated (based on other parameters) is divided by this value to obtain the block length, and a break is inserted following the end of each block. This value must be a factor or multiple of 32, or block lengths will not be a whole integer and Presentation will crash.
- Maximum Repetitions - This specifies how many occurrences of each unique trial and block is presented. If left at a value of 1, the experiment will end when all trials and blocks have been presented once. If a value of 2, a second run of unique trials and blocks will be presented following the first, and so on. Useful if the number of unique trials generated is few, but the total number of trials desired is larger.

## Trial Timing
- Fixation Duration - period in ms that the fixation cross is displayed prior to onset of the main stimulus
- Exposure Duration - period that the main stimulus is visible on the display. The stimulus is replaced by a ? prompt when this period expires. Participants may respond during this period.
- Trial Duration - period that the trial will last until the trial ends if a response has not yet been made. Participants may respond during this period.

## Practice Trials

- Run Practice Trials - A short block of practice trials with feedback is presented prior to the main task. This is a good opportunity for participants to learn the response mapping, and the practice block may be repeated as many times as desired before participants move on to the main task.
- Practice Block Size - The number of trials presented in the practice block. This value must be smaller than the block length calculated earlier from the Maximum Blocks value, but a value <= 32 is always safe to use.

## Local Element sizing and spacing

- Local Element Size - This adjusts the size of the local elements in pixels and, consequently, the size of the overall global figure. You may want to change this value based on your setup.
- Gap - This adjusts the size of the gap between local elements in pixels. A value of 1 creates a thin outline around each local element, similar to the stimuli used by the original authors of this task, Huberle & Karnath (2012). A value of 0 will remove the outline, whilst values larger than 1 will make it thicker, distance local elements in the process. This parameter also affects the size of the overall global figure. The 'gap' between local elements is the same colour as the background; neutral gray (RGG: 128, 128, 128).

## Logfile save behaviour

- Use Local Save - Whilst the task can be run from a network location, this occasionally introduces read/write errors that Presentation cannot handle and will terminate the task unexpectedly. If this parameter is set to TRUE, Presentation will write logfile data to a C:/Presentation Output/ during the scenario. Immediately, prior to the 'Experiment Complete' screen, Presentation will attempt to write a copy of the output to the main logfile where the experiment files are located. Presentation will notify the experimenter if this write operation fails, and should Presentation crash during this operation, an intact logfile will remain in C:/Presentation Output. If this parameter is set to FALSE, Presentation will create a logfile in the local of the experiment files as usual, '.../Degraded Global Figures/Logfiles'.

## Screen resolution check and scaling

- Screen Check - if TRUE, Presentation will first check that the display is set to 1920 x 1080. If it is not, Presentation can attempt to scale the stimuli as if they were presented using this resolution. Whilst it is always preferable to run the experiment at the native resolution, this may not be possible if certain administration restrictions are in place, hence while this setting exists.

## Parameter Summary

- run_parameter_check - if TRUE, Presentation will first check the entered parameters and provide some information about the scenario setup prior to beginning the instructions, such as block lengths, practice trials, and other parameters. This may be useful to ensure that your setup is configured desirably prior to running participants. If FALSE, this message will not be displayed and the scenario will run as normal.
